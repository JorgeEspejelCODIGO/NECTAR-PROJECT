# "Data" project

This is the final project for the subject "Data Acquisition Analysis and Scientific Methods for Life Sciences" shorted as "Data" from the first course of the Master Plant Health at the Universitat Politècnica de València.

In this project the students chose a scientific article and redo all possible statistic analyses and graphics from it, trying different approaches to see if they can improve them. They will use the data included in the article and follow the Material and methods chapter as a guide.

## Chosen article

[The nectar report: quantitative review of nectar sugar concentrations offered by bee visited flowers in agricultural and non-agricultural landscapes](https://peerj.com/articles/6329/)

## Proposal

The dataset includes nectar sugar concentrations for various plant species, classified by taxonomic details (Family, Genus, species) and geographical presence (continents). This data can be used to explore ecological and geographical patterns influencing nectar sugar concentration.

I see your data have only one dependent variable (sugar concentration) and the independent variables of species and countries. It is not enough to do a multivariate analyses. 

But on the other side you have several plant species and can learn how to relate them using their phylogenetic relations. This will make the project more interesting. I want you to relate the sugar concentration with the phylogeny. 

For the phylogenetic relationships you can follow the "Tree of life" database and this tutorial to start: https://mctavishlab.github.io/BIO144/labs/rotl-rgbif.html

### Objectives

**Primary Objective**:\
To investigate the relationships between plant taxonomy (e.g., family, genus) and nectar sugar concentration across geographical regions.

**Secondary Objectives**:

-   To assess how sugar concentrations vary geographically

-   To determine whether globally distributed genera exhibit higher sugar concentrations compared to genera present in limited regions.

-   To analyze sugar concentration variability within high-performing families and identify key genera.

### Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis**:

-   **H₀ (Null Hypothesis)**: There is no significant relationship between plant taxonomy (family, genus) and nectar sugar concentration.

-   **H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis)**: Plant taxonomy significantly affects nectar sugar concentration.

**Secondary Hypotheses**:

-   **Geographical Variation**:

-   **H₀**: Nectar sugar concentration does not vary significantly across geographical regions (continents or hemispheres).

-   **H₁**: Nectar sugar concentration varies significantly across geographical regions.

**Taxonomic Contribution**:

-   **H₀**: Within high-performing families, genera do not significantly differ in their contributions to higher average sugar concentrations.

-   **H₁**: Certain genera within high-performing families significantly drive higher average sugar concentrations.

### Analysis

**Descriptive Analysis**:

-   Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for sugar concentrations across families, genera, and geographical regions.

-   Visualize data distribution across regions and taxonomic levels using box plots and histograms.

**Geographical Impact**:

-   Analyze geographical distribution by calculating mean sugar concentrations

-   Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., ANOVA) to evaluate geographical differences in nectar sugar concentration.

**Taxonomic Analysis**:

-   Compare families and genera to identify high-performing groups.

-   Use regression models to evaluate the significance of family and genus as predictors of sugar concentration.

**Correlation Analysis**:

-   Compute a correlation matrix to explore relationships between taxonomic details, geographical presence, and sugar concentration.

**Advanced Modeling**:

-   Build a regression model with sugar concentration as the dependent variable, and taxonomic and geographical features as predictors.

-   Use this model to predict the potential impact of changes in geographical distribution or taxonomy on nectar sugar concentration.
